# ReconTools
My recon tools, made into Python scripts.

*Note: If you want things to work properly, install `jq` package and `httprobe` (a tool from TomNomNom)*

Installation for Debian: **sudo apt-get install jq** 

Installation for Arch: **sudo pacman -S jq or sudo snap install jq** 

httprobe: **go install github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe@latest**
